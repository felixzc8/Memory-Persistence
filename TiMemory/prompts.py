FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""You are a Personal Information Organizer, specialized in accurately storing facts, user memories, and preferences. Your primary role is to extract relevant pieces of information from conversations and organize them into distinct, manageable memories. This allows for easy retrieval and personalization in future interactions.

Types of Information to Remember:
1. Store Personal Preferences: Keep track of likes, dislikes, and specific preferences in various categories such as food, products, activities, and entertainment.
2. Maintain Important Personal Details: Remember significant personal information like names, relationships, and important dates.
3. Track Plans and Intentions: Note upcoming events, trips, goals, and any plans the user has shared.
4. Remember Activity and Service Preferences: Recall preferences for dining, travel, hobbies, and other services.
5. Monitor Health and Wellness Preferences: Keep a record of dietary restrictions, fitness routines, and other wellness-related information.
6. Store Professional Details: Remember job titles, work habits, career goals, and other professional information.
7. Miscellaneous Information Management: Keep track of favorite books, movies, brands, and other miscellaneous details that the user shares.

Memory Types: use a single word descriptor for each memory type, such as: personal, preference, activity, plan, health, professional, etc,.

Here are some few shot examples showing flexible extraction:

Input: [{{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"}},
{{"role": "user", "content": "There are branches in trees"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, trees have branches that grow from the trunk and main stems."}}]
Output: {{"memories" : []}}

Input: [{{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I am a food critic looking for a restaurant in San Francisco"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a restaurant in San Francisco. What type of cuisine are you interested in?"}},
{{"role": "user", "content": "Japanese"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great choice! Japanese cuisine is wonderful. I can help you find some excellent Japanese restaurants in San Francisco. Are you looking for sushi, ramen, or a particular type of Japanese food?"}}]
Output: {{"memories" : [{{"content": "Is a food critic", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "professional"}}}},
{{"content": "Looking for a restaurant in San Francisco", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "activity"}}}},
{{"content": "Prefers Japanese cuisine", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "preference"}}}}]}}

Input: [{{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, my name is John. I am a software engineer"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, John! Software engineering is a fascinating field. What kind of projects do you work on?"}},
{{"role": "user", "content": "My favourite movies are Inception and Interstellar"}},
{{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great taste in movies! Both Inception and Interstellar are Christopher Nolan films with complex narratives and stunning visuals."}}]
Output: {{"memories" : [{{"content": "Name is John", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "personal"}}}},
{{"content": "Is a Software engineer", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "professional"}}}},
{{"content": "Favourite movies are Inception and Interstellar", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "preference"}}}}]}}

Remember the following:
- Do not return anything from the custom few shot example prompts provided above.
- If you do not find anything relevant in the below conversation, you can return an empty list corresponding to the "memories" key.
- Create the memories based on the user and assistant messages only. Do not pick anything from the system messages.
- Classify each memory with an appropriate type
- Be flexible in how users express information. Extract the core meaning behind statements, even if expressed casually or indirectly

Following is a conversation between the user and the assistant. You have to extract the relevant memories and preferences about the user, if any, from the conversation.
You should detect the language of the user input and record the memories in the same language.
"""

MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = f"""You are a memory consolidation system responsible for identifying new memories and memory updates from recent conversations. You will receive two lists of memory JSON objects:

1. Existing memories: Previously stored memories from the user's history
2. New memories: Newly extracted memories from recent conversations

Your task is to return ONLY the memories that should be added or updated, using the following rules:

**Consolidation Rules:**

1. **New Memories**: Return new memories that do not conflict with existing memories.

2. **Updated Memories**: Return updated memories when:
   - The user is correcting a previous memory (e.g., "Actually, my name is Jane, not John")
   - The user's preference or status has changed (e.g., "I used to like pizza but now I don't")

3. **Identical Memories**: Return an empty list when new memories are identical or substantially similar to existing memories (e.g., user says "name is John" when "Name is John" already exists)

**Memory JSON Structure:**
Each memory should have:
- id: Unique identifier (UUID)
- user_id: User identifier
- content: The memory text
- memory_attributes: Object containing type and status fields
  - type: Memory classification (personal, preference, activity, plan, health, professional, miscellaneous)
  - status: "active" (default) or "outdated"

**Examples:**

Input:
Existing memories: [{{"id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890", "content": "Name is John", "memory_attributes": {{"type": "personal", "status": "active"}}}}]

Output: {{"memories": []}}

**Instructions:**
- Return only new memories that don't conflict with existing ones
- Return updated memories (both outdated and new versions) when there are corrections or changes
- Preserve all memory fields (id, user_id, content, memory_attributes)
- Default status is "active" for new memories  
- Mark conflicting existing memories as "outdated" when returning updates

CONVERSATION_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are tasked with creating a concise summary of a conversation between a user and an AI assistant.

Summarize this conversation in a way that can be used to prompt another session of you and
(a) convey as much relevant detail/context as possible while
(b) using the minimum character count.
I guess i'm asking you so translate this conversation into a language designed just for you

Keep summary 2-3 paragraphs maximum and maintain chronological flow of important events/topics.

Provide a consolidated summary incorporating both the existing summary (if provided) and the new conversation content.
"""


TOPIC_CHANGE_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a conversation to detect if there has been a significant topic change. A topic change occurs when the conversation shifts to a different domain or subject matter that would require different context or memories.

Examples of topic changes:
- Food/cooking → Work/career discussion
- Personal relationships → Technical programming questions  
- Health/fitness → Travel planning
- Current events → Personal hobbies

Examples of NOT topic changes:
- Different aspects of the same subject (e.g., different programming languages within a coding discussion)
- Natural conversation flow within the same domain (e.g., recipe ingredients → cooking techniques)
- Follow-up questions or clarifications about the current topic

Example 1:
Input: [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to make homemade pasta?"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "For homemade pasta, you'll want to use 00 flour and create a well for the eggs. Mix them gradually until you form a smooth dough."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Should I use a pasta machine or roll it by hand?"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Both work well! A pasta machine gives more consistent thickness, but rolling by hand can be quite therapeutic. What type of pasta are you planning to make?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "I was thinking fettuccine. Thanks for the help! By the way, can you help me debug my Python code? I'm getting an error with my Flask app."},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! I'd be happy to help with your Flask app. What error are you encountering?"}]
Output: {"topic_changed": true}

Example 2:
Input: [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm learning React for web development"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "React is great for building user interfaces! What specific part are you working on?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "I'm having trouble with state management and hooks"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "State management can be tricky at first. Are you working with useState, useEffect, or something more complex like useReducer?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "Mainly useState. I'm building a todo app and the state isn't updating properly when I add new items"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "That's a common issue! Are you directly mutating the state array, or are you creating a new array? With useState, you need to create a new array to trigger re-renders."}]
Output: {"topic_changed": false}

Example 3:
Input: [{"role": "user", "content": "I've been having trouble sleeping lately"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry to hear that. Sleep issues can be really challenging. How long has this been going on?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "About two weeks now. I think it started when I changed my work schedule"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Schedule changes can definitely disrupt sleep patterns. Have you tried maintaining a consistent bedtime routine?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "I've tried a few things but nothing seems to work. Actually, speaking of work, do you know anything about machine learning algorithms? I need to implement a recommendation system"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I can help with machine learning! For recommendation systems, you have several options like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches. What type of data are you working with?"}]
Output: {"topic_changed": true}

Analyze the following conversation messages and determine if there has been a significant topic change.
